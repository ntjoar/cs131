For this project, I was more comfortable with using C and C++ in the first place, making recursional thinking a little more difficult and time consuming. Additionally, withh all the new coding methods, it took me a little bit of time to really read and understand the different commands and prompts fully.
For this project, I took most of my approaches from a more head-tail standpoint. The idea behind this was to sort of create an environment so I could do recursion, but it would still be similar to ther process of iterating through an array. The difficulty ere is the infinite recursion loops that could happen. 
The project spec was rathher unclear at first until I began reading the test cases and dissecting what each one meant and what I was supposed to do from there. 
Below, I have linked sources I used, though I did not use any of their code. Rather, I used these sources as a reference sheet while I was coding.
