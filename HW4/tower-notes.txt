    Some Piazza questions asked gave me answers to my questions

Speedup:
    tower(4, _, counts([4,3,2,1],[1,2,2,2],[4,3,2,1],[1,2,2,2]))
    Returned a ratio of about a 40x speedup value.

Ambiguous:
    tower(4, T, C)
    C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
    T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]]
    T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]]
